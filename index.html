          <p1>I've always been a fan of art and visiting art museums. My interest in Matisse sparked after seeing a piece from The Cut Outs collection.
            I was inspired by his brilliant colors and the playful energy his art exudes. His work calls me to view life with different colors, something
            his art conveys so effortlessly; he could take something as ordinary as a cat, or flowers, and turn it into something extraordinary. 
            My hope is that this website encourages you to view life with more color and wonder, as Matisse did.

      <h1> About Matisse </h1>
      <body> 
        <p>Henri Émile Benoît Matisse was a French artist, known for his use of color. Matisse is commonly regarded as one of the artists who helped to define revolutionary developments in art in the twentieth century. 
        The extensive and intense use of color in his works between 1900 and 1905 coined him as one of the Fauves, a group of French painters known as "wild beasts" for their strong colors and fierce brushstrokes.
